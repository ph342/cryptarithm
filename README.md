# cryptarithm
Submission to the first round of the 33rd Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BwInf)

## Description
An alphametic puzzle (also sometimes known as a cryptarithm) is a type of puzzle where words are put together into an arithmetic formula such that digits can be substituted for the letters to make the formula true:

`ABC – DBB = EFG <=> 620 – 122 = 498`

## Execution
The program has two execution modes. In the first, the user can enter a formula and the program finds numbers that make the formula true:

In the second, the program finds cryptarithms that are also true when spoken, e.g. `ONE + ONE = TWO`.
